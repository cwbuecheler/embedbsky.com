						<li>
							<u>Governing Law and Forum Choice</u>. These Terms and any action related thereto will

					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							<u>Informal Resolution</u>. Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have
							an issue with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit
							or arbitration. You can do this by sending us a written description of the dispute,
							including your name, an email or a phone number for us to contact you, the nature of
							the complaint, and how you would like to resolve it, as a Direct Message to
							Christopher Buecheler on BlueSky. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60)
							days after we receive your written notice, we agree to proceed with further dispute
							resolution as outlined below. Attempting an informal resolution process is required
							before starting any formal dispute resolution. During this process, any applicable
							statutes of limitations and deadlines for arbitration filing fees or other

								</em>
							</Text>
							The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&rdquo;
							<strong>AAA</strong>&ldquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &rdquo;
							<strong>AAA Rules</strong>&ldquo;) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
							The AAA Rules are available at <Anchor href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</Anchor>{' '}
							or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you want to start arbitration, you must submit a
							written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified
							in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at{' '}
							<Anchor href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</Anchor>.<br />
							Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live,
							unless we both agree to a different location. Both parties agree that the arbitrator
							shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation,
							applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Arbitration Costs</u>. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees
							will be governed by the AAA Rules. If we prevail in arbitration we&apos;ll pay all of
							our attorneys&apos; fees and costs and won&apos;t seek to recover them from you,
							unless the arbitrator determines your claims were frivolous. If you prevail in
							arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&apos; fees and expenses to
							the extent provided under applicable law.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</u>. Except as provided in Section 15(c) above,
							the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim
							asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor
							of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide
							relief warranted by that party&apos;s individual claim. To the extent that you or we
							prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that
							has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future
							injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated
							in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
							that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the
							outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
